### Custom Process Class
- **`MyProcess`**: Inherits from `multiprocessing.Process`.
- The `run` method is overridden to print the name of the process.

### Process Creation and Execution
- In a loop, 10 instances of `MyProcess` are created.
- Each process is started with `process.start()` and the main program waits for it to finish using `process.join()`.

### Process Lifecycle
- **`start()`**: Initiates the process, executing the `run` method.
- **`join()`**: Ensures the main program waits for the process to complete before proceeding to the next iteration.

### Output
For each iteration, the message 'called run method in Process-X' is printed, where X represents the process number (e.g., Process-1, Process-2, etc.).
