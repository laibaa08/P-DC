### Function `function_square`
- Takes an input value and returns its square.

### Process Pool
- A `multiprocessing.Pool` is created with 4 worker processes.
- The `pool.map(function_square, inputs)` method applies the `function_square` function to each element in the `inputs` list, returning the results in a new list.

### Process Pool Management
- **`pool.close()`**: Closes the pool to prevent any further tasks from being added.
- **`pool.join()`**: Waits for all worker processes to complete their tasks.

### Inputs and Outputs
- The `inputs` list contains numbers from 0 to 99.
- The squares of these numbers are calculated and stored as `pool_outputs`.

### Output
The program outputs the squares of numbers from 0 to 99, computed by 4 parallel processes.
