### Function `foo`
- Each process begins by printing its start message.
- If the process is named 'background_process', it loops from 0 to 4, printing those numbers.
- For the 'NO_background_process', it loops from 5 to 9, printing those numbers.
- After the loop, each process sleeps for 1 second and then prints its exit message.

### Processes
- **`background_process`**: This process is named 'background_process' and executes the loop for numbers 0 to 4.
- **`NO_background_process`**: This process is named 'NO_background_process' and executes the loop for numbers 5 to 9.

### Daemon Flag
Both processes have their daemon attribute set to False, which means the main program will wait for them to complete before exiting.

### Process Execution
- Both processes are started using the `start()` method and will run concurrently.
- They will print their respective number ranges (0-4 and 5-9) along with their start and exit messages.
