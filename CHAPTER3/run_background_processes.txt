### Function `foo`
- Each process executes the `foo` function.
- It prints numbers based on the process name ('background_process' or another).
- The function sleeps for 1 second after completing the loop.

### Process Creation
- **`background_process`**: A daemon process that terminates when the main program finishes.
- **`NO_background_process`**: A non-daemon process that continues running until it completes its task.

### Execution
- Both processes operate concurrently.
- The `background_process` prints numbers 0-4 and then exits.
- The `NO_background_process` prints numbers 5-9 and runs to completion after the main program ends.

### Daemon Process
The `background_process` stops immediately when the main program exits.

### Non-Daemon Process
The `NO_background_process` keeps running until it finishes its execution.
