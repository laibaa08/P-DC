### Function `myFunc`
- Prints the name of the current process.
- Sleeps for 3 seconds to simulate a task.
- Exits and prints the process name again.

### Processes
- **`process_with_name`**: A custom-named process, labeled 'myFunc process'.
- **`process_with_default_name`**: Uses the default naming convention for processes (e.g., Process-1).

### Process Lifecycle
- Both processes are initiated using the `start()` method.
- The `join()` method ensures that the main program waits for both processes to complete.

### Output
The name of each process is printed upon starting and exiting. The processes run concurrently.
