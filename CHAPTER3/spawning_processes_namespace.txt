### Imports
- **`multiprocessing`**: Used for creating and managing processes.
- **`myFunc`**: A custom function (assumed to be defined elsewhere) that will be executed in parallel by each process.

### Main Execution
- In the `__main__` block, a loop iterates 6 times (from 0 to 5).
- In each iteration:
  - A new process is created using `multiprocessing.Process`.
  - **`target=myFunc`**: Specifies the function to be executed.
  - **`args=(i,)`**: Passes the current iteration value (`i`) as an argument to `myFunc`.
  - The process is started using `process.start()`.
  - The `process.join()` method ensures that the main program waits for the process to complete before moving on to the next iteration.

### Key Points
- **`multiprocessing.Process`**: Creates a new process for each iteration.
- **`process.start()`**: Initiates the execution of the process.
- **`process.join()`**: Ensures the main program waits for each process to finish before continuing to the next iteration.
